## Self-Reflection:
I really enjoyed using phaser, it was nice and simple and seems like there can be alot done with it to make some slick 2d games!
### How long it took me to finish this?
it took me about 3 hours in total, only because I couldnt get the dang web server to work for me and VS code kept inserting code I didnt want that would set requirements that would ruin the whole thing, I got it working though!
